Difference between thread.start() vs run(),
Run:  native thread invokes the run() method in the Java thread,
        which makes thread state change from Runnable to Running.

Start(): When you call t1.start(), it starts a new thread and calls the run()
        method of r1 internally to execute it within that new thread.
